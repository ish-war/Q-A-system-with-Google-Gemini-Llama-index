* Allows users to upload files (up to 200 MB) for processing.
* Dynamically generates answers to user queries based on the uploaded document's content.
2. AI Model Integration:
* Utilizes the Google Gemini Model (Gemini Pro) for generative AI tasks.
* Built with Llama Index for seamless model integration and document indexing.
* Implements Gemini embeddings for accurate query-response generation.
3. Vector Store Indexing:
* Efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings using a vector store.
4. Interactive Streamlit Interface:
* Clean and responsive UI for document upload, question submission, and answer visualization.
